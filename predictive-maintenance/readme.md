# Predictive Maintenance Module

This folder demonstrates how Copernicus (or other forecast) data is planned to be integrated for predictive maintenance.

- `copernicus_fetcher.py`: Simulates fetching dust/sandstorm risk from Copernicus API.
- `predictive_trigger.py`: Shows how forecast risk triggers preemptive cleaning or resource scaling.

**Planned workflow:**  
1. Regularly fetch external environmental/forecast data (e.g., sandstorm risk).
2. If risk crosses a defined threshold, NebulOuS orchestrator preemptively triggers cleaning tasks or re-allocates resources.
3. This predictive step is integrated ahead of sensor-based event triggers, making the system proactive, not just reactive.

**TODO:**  
- Replace simulation with real Copernicus API call.
- Integrate the preemptive trigger with actual edge/cloud orchestration (e.g., via NebulOuS OAM, Kubernetes, or direct API).
